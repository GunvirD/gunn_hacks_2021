                        Leonardo DiCaprio is a very well known actor and film producer. But little do people know that he is also a huge environmentalist. In 1998, Leonardo DiCaprio founded The Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation as an effort to help address and respond to the growing climate crisis. His foundation has supported 132 organizations that are dedicated to the long-term health and wellbeing of all of Earth’s inhabitants and animals. He also joined the 2017 People’s Climate March which was a protest that took place in over 300 locations in and around the U.S. On top of that, in 2014, Leo spoke at the United Nations Climate Change Summit and was appointed as a Messenger of Peace. Not too long ago, DiCaprio donated $5 million through his new organization called Earth Alliance to help combat the Amazonian wildfires.

Shawn Mendes' efforts with Flow Water for his worldwide shows include offsetting carbon emissions, ensuring sustainable catering, donating excess food/toiletries to shelters, and removing the estimated 70 000 plastic bottles found backstage during concerts by replacing them with Flow’s low-impact paper bottles. There will also be programs related to environmental education during his shows.

                    Now, you don’t have to be famous or rich to help save the planet. To combat climate change, we need as many hands-on-deck as possible. Something as simple as using reusable or recyclable alternatives can help save the planet (and save you some money).
