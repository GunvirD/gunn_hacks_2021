                  <li>
                    There are many common misconceptions about eating healthy. One, it costs too much. Two, it's too much work and so on. Stop making excuses and start taking care of your body for a change. Don’t we all want to live longer?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    This one’s pretty obvious but how to actually eat healthy is so foreign to many. Diets rich in fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy and low-wholegrains(link to gluten free blog) lower the risk of many heart related and obesity related diseases by maintaining your body's levels of blood pressure and cholesterol-caused by high levels of salt and saturated fats. Eating a healthy portion of fish like salmon or trout at least once a week also reduces the risks for heart-diseases, since the omega fatty acids help to keep your heart in tip-top shape! Calcium also ensures that your bones stay healthy and strong, even preventing bone loss!

                    It's no secret that exercising boosts life expectancy. Staying physically active adds years to life span and keeps you looking and feeling healthy! Even 15 minutes of exercise a day can provide many benefits and add 2-3 years onto your life.
                    How to exercise:
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        First off start small and be realistic. Don't just start working out for hours a day. This way you wont get discouraged about your progress.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Try working out for just 150 minutes a week. After you gain more confidence and stamina, turn the 150 minutes to 250, 300 and so on.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Plan ahead to ensure that you have enough time to get in those essential hours of exercise every week.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    It's a no-brainer that smoking and excessive alcohol damages your health.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Alcohol</strong>
                    <br>
                    Try avoiding the bottled killer to reduce chances of alcohol poisoning, cancer, heart damage, liver failure which eventually leads to death. Heavy alcohol consumption is directly linked to cancer, heart and liver damage. Alcohol scars and damages the liver which interferes with the liver’s ability to metabolize the toxic chemical. This in turn results in fat accumulation on the organ- ultimately leading to hepatitis or cirrhosis as the liver starts to have organ failure when the filtration of blood stops which creates organ failure throughout the body. Alcohol also damages the heart-leading to heart failure due to high blood pressure.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Smoking</strong>
                    <br>
                    Smoking is known to have many health effects such as increased chance of stroke, coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular issues making it the leading killer in many countries worldwide. Smoking damages blood vessels, making them grow thinner and thicker- increasing the chance of blood clots and high blood pressure. I know what you're thinking, a few cigarettes won’t hurt- well yes they will. Even people who smoke less than 5 cigarettes a day already have a higher chance of developing cardiovascular diseases. Don’t gamble with your life.
                    Make the change and take a step in the right direction.
